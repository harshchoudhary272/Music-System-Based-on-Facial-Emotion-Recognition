# Music-System-Based-on-Facial-Emotion-Recognition
This project is totally focused on generating a playlist of songs depending on the end user's facial expression/emotions.
The foundation of this project is Machine Learning based Training model. By using CNN and RCNN optimization algorithms data training model has been made.
The python program focuses on fetching the end-user's facial expression by using his/her web-cam.
UI is totally focused on getting end-user's attention into the project.
UI tells the user to how to use the application and keeps the functionality of the application smooth, easy and simple.
This project is made after studing different research papers and by adding uniqueness into this project.
Uniqueness of this project are: Huge dataset, More facial expressions, Optimization : Adam, Early stopping, Adding checkpoints.
